# Box-Theory_Script
This project will be implementing Darvas' Box Theory, used to determine when to buy/sell certain stocks.
It will be written in Python and will use data scraping to find the best stocks to use and when it should buy/sell them.
Eventually it will be connected to a stock exchange website so that it can automatically buy/sell, rather than having to wait tuntil the user does it.

Possible Future Additions:
Implement machine learning so that the program learns from its mistakes.

**Instructions** 
Once a base script has been completed, instructions for how to setup/run this script will be inserted here.
